# KaunBanegaCrorepatti Program

## Description

This repository contains four Python scripts for a Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) game:

* `KBC_Program_With_Voice_ConsoleBased.py`: A console-based KBC game with voice output.
* `KBC_Program_WithOut_Voice_GUIBased_v1.py`: A GUI-based KBC game without voice output.
* `KBC_Program_With_Voice_GUIBased_v2_Error.py`: A GUI-based KBC game with voice output (contains errors).
* `BonusProgram_Mean_Calculator.py`: A bonus program to calculate the mean of a dataset.

## Scripts

### KBC_Program_With_Voice_ConsoleBased.py

* A console-based KBC game with voice output.
* Uses `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech functionality.
* Asks questions, user inputs answers, and keeps track of balance.

### KBC_Program_WithOut_Voice_GUIBased_v1.py

* A GUI-based KBC game without voice output.
* Uses Kivy library for creating GUI.
* Asks questions, user inputs answers, and keeps track of balance.

### KBC_Program_With_Voice_GUIBased_v2_Error.py

* Similar to previous script but contains errors.
* Intended for debugging purposes.

### BonusProgram_Mean_Calculator.py

* Calculates mean of a dataset.
* Asks user to input type of mean calculation (arithmetic or harmonic) and method (ungrouped or grouped).
* Calculates and displays mean.

## Running the Scripts

To run each script, simply execute the Python file using a Python interpreter:

**For example:**

* To run `KBC_Program_With_Voice_ConsoleBased.py`:

  ```bash
  python KBC_Program_With_Voice_ConsoleBased.py
* To run KBC_Program_WithOut_Voice_GUIBased_v1.py:
  
  ```bash
  python KBC_Program_WithOut_Voice_GUIBased_v1.py
* To run `KBC_Program_With_Voice_GUIBased_v2_Error.py`:

  ```bash
  python KBC_Program_With_Voice_GUIBased_v2_Error.py
* To run `BonusProgram_Mean_Calculator.py`:

  ```bash
  python BonusProgram_Mean_Calculator.py
**Make sure to install required libraries (`pyttsx3` and `kivy`) before running scripts.**
